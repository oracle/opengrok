Checklist for releasing OpenGrok:
--------------------------------------
../ext_lib - is a directory where we keep latest JFlex.jar and all necessary jars/dirs for tests

0) set proper version in build.xml , <property name="version" value="???"/>

1) build must be clean
ant -lib ../ext_lib/ clean
ant -lib ../ext_lib/ 
(defaults to jar currently)

2) check all tests, tests code coverage: junit, pmd, findbugs, checkstyle, emma, jdepend
(they should be ok, currently only checkstyle has 7 warnings, the rest is clean;
emma reports should be based according to what is set for the release, usually it's overall coverage above 80%)
(hudson can help here, see README.txt on setup)

3) produce proper distributions, check them before upload
ant -lib ../ext_lib/ dist
ant -lib ../ext_lib/ dist-src
ant -lib ../ext_lib/ package

the release is OK, once above is fullfilled to our satisfaction
