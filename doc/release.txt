Checklist for releasing OpenGrok:
---------------------------------

../ext_lib - is a directory where we keep latest JFlex.jar and all necessary
jars/dirs for tests

0) set proper version in build.xml

   <property name="version" value="???"/>

   and put some stuff into CHANGES.txt

   Then commit the change:

     git commit

1) build must be clean

   ant clean
   ant # defaults to jar currently

2) check all tests, tests code coverage:
   junit, pmd, findbugs, checkstyle, emma, jdepend

They should be ok, currently only checkstyle has 8 warnings, the rest is
clean; emma reports should be based according to what is set for the release,
usually it's overall coverage above 80%)

(jenkins can help here, see README.txt on setup)

The release is OK, once above is fullfilled to our satisfaction.

3) tag the build used for release so we can get back to it:

   git tag 0.XYZ
   git push origin --tags

4) produce proper distributions

Check them before upload, always try to build on Solaris, since gnu tar might
create a non-standard compliant .tgz version and tag from step 0) will be used
to produce the archive

  ant dist
  ant package

The command above creates both formats of package .pkg and .p5p into the directory dist


Note that for the IPS package *.p5p the version names are translated this way:
0.12          ~       0.12.0.1.0
0.<n>         ~       0.<n>.0.1.0
...

0.12-rc1      ~       0.12.0.0.1
0.12-rc<i>    ~       0.12.0.0.<i>
...

(Note that the release candidate must follow imediately after the basic version number (0.12))


0.12.1        ~       0.12.1.0.0
0.12.<j>      ~       0.12.<j>.0.0
...

0.12.0.1      ~       0.12.0.1.1
0.12.0.<k>    ~       0.12.0.1.<k>
...

5) Upload them using https://github.com/OpenGrok/OpenGrok/releases

   Note that the files with packages have to be gzipped otherwise github
   upload does not allow them.

6) Generate cryptographic digests for all the binaries.

   e.g. using openssl:

     openssl dgst -sha256 <file1> <file2> ..

7) Modify the download links and add the digests to
   http://opengrok.github.io/OpenGrok/

   git fetch --all
   git checkout gh-pages
   < now edit index.html >
   git commit index.html
   git push
