Setting up the sample Razor repository
======================================

Razor is a centralised Source Code Management and Issue Tracking
System, whose basics are described in more detail in
RazorRepository.java (which can be found in
opengrok/src/org/opensolaris/opengrok/history directory).

A normal OpenGrok user would extract a read-only checkout of the files
and directories from Razor they wished OpenGrok to process using
'threads' or 'versions' into $SRC_ROOT or a subdirectory of $SRC_ROOT.
They would then be required to create a symlink to from the base
directory of the checkout to the relevant group directory inside the
Razor repository file structure as documented in RazorRepository.java.

We therefore have two quite separate directory trees required for a
simulation of a Razor repository, the centralised repository and the
user level checkout of the current state of the repository. As such,
two archives have been provided representing these two directory
trees.

The repository archive contains the Razor Universe 'OpenGrokSample' and
the Razor Group 'Simple', which itself contains several sub-directories
of user controlled files. These files should be extracted to location
outside of SRC_ROOT so they are not processed by OpenGrok directly.

The user sandbox archive contains the a read-only checkout of all the
head revision of the files is in the Razor group 'Simple'. These files
should be extracted under $SRC_ROOT or a sub-directory of it.

The following example should correctly construct a sample file set that
when processed by OpenGrok will result in the relevant version and
history information being extracted extracted from the Razor repository
file structure. It assumes that the variables REPO_ROOT, SRC_ROOT and
ARCHIVES are set correctly for your environment and that we wish all
the files in the Razor group 'Simple' to be extracted in a
sub-directory of $SRC_ROOT.

  Examples Variable Values

	REPO_ROOT=/data
	SRC_ROOT=/data/opengrok/src
	ARCHIVES=/src/opengrok/RazorArchives

  Repository Setup

	cd ${REPO_ROOT}
	tar fxv ${ARCHIVES}/SampleRazorRepository.tar.gz

  OpenGrok Source Setup

	cd ${SRC_ROOT}
	tar fxv ${ARCHIVES}/SampleRazorUserSandbox.tar.gz
	mv UserSandbox Razor-Simple

  Link each top-level directory checkout to its group directory in the
central repository (as discussed in RazorRepository.java)

	cd Razor-Simple
	cd SimpleCProgram
	ln -s ${REPO_ROOT}/Repository/OpenGrokSample/RAZOR_UNIVERSE/DOMAIN_01/Simple .razor
	cd ..
	cd SimpleCProgram-BinaryRelease
	ln -s ${REPO_ROOT}/Repository/OpenGrokSample/RAZOR_UNIVERSE/DOMAIN_01/Simple .razor
	cd ${SRC_ROOT}

  Ask OpenGrok to process the new addition

	OpenGrok update

  Verify the files have history and annotation information and can be differenced
in the OpenGrok web interface.


Assumptions:
  - The 'tar' command was assumed to be a recent GNU tar implementation
  - The 'OpenGrok' command from the OpenGrok distribution has been
    configured for the local OpenGrok installation
