# 
# This file will configure scripts to be run before and
# after the execution of a command in the Threads tool.  
# The format of this file is a tab separated list of button name, 
# script to execute before performing the operation, and script 
# to execute after performing the operation.  A 'n/a' in a field 
# indicates no script should be executed.
#
# The button names are defined as panel.button.  For example, if 
# you want to attach a script to the 'Apply' button on the 'Create'
# popup panel, the button definition would be 'create.apply'.
#
# Either or both fields may be designated as 'n/a'. 
# Also note that the indicated scripts MUST reside on each users 
# search path.
#
#	Note: The exit.apply entry only honors the BEFORE
#	script and ignores the AFTER script.
