## 1. Introduction

OpenGrok is a fast and usable source code search and cross reference
engine, written in Java. It helps you search, cross-reference and navigate
your source tree. It can understand various program file formats and
version control histories of many source code management systems.

Official page of the project is on:
<https://oracle.github.io/opengrok/>

## 2. Installation

See https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/wiki/How-to-setup-OpenGrok

### 2. 1. Updating

OpenGrok uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and the version components further indicate more details about updating to newer version. The version scheme is *major.minor.micro* and change in any component is interpreted as:

- major - major backwards incompatible update, will require full reindex as well as configuration changes
- minor - full clean reindex of your repositories is needed (e. g. index format has changed)
- micro - redeploy web application

Generally it is possible to go backward only within the micro version.

## 3. Information for developers
