OpenGrok - a wicked fast source browser
---------------------------------------

OpenGrok is a fast and usable source code search and cross reference
engine, written in Java. It helps you search, cross-reference and navigate
your source tree. It can understand various program file formats and
version control histories like SCCS, RCS, CVS, Subversion and Mercurial.

OpenGrok is the tool used for the OpenSolaris Source Browser.

Requirements
------------
    * Latest Java http://java.sun.com/ (At least 1.5)
    * A servlet container like Tomcat (5.x or later)
      http://tomcat.apache.org/
      supporting Servlet 2.4 and JSP 2.0
    * Exuberant Ctags http://ctags.sourceforge.net/
    * Subversion 1.3.0 or later if SVN support is needed
      http://subversion.tigris.org/
    * Mercurial 0.9.3 or later if Mercurial support is needed
      http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/
    * JFlex Ant task (If you want to build OpenGrok)
      http://www.jflex.org/


Usage
-----
SRC_ROOT refers to the directory containing your source tree.
OpenGrok analyzes the source tree and builds a search index along with
cross-referenced hypertext versions of the source files. These generated
data files will be stored in DATA_ROOT directory. 

OpenGrok setup Step.0 - Setting up the Sources.
----------------------------------------------
Source base must be available locally for OpenGrok to work efficiently. No
changes are required to your source tree. If the code is under source control
management (SCM) OpenGrok requires the checked out source tree under SRC_ROOT.
It is possible for some SCM systems to use a remote repository (Subversion),
but this is not recommended due to the performance penalty. CVS must have a
local repository.
Note that OpenGrok ignores symbolic links.

---------------------------------------------------
Using command line interface.
---------------------------------------------------

Step.1 - Populate DATA_ROOT Directory
=====================================
Option 1. OpenGrok: There is a sample shell script OpenGrok that is suitable
for using in a cronjob to run regularly. Modify the variables in the script
to point appropriate directories, or as the code suggests factor your local
configuration into a seperate file and simplify future upgrades.

Option 2. opengrok.jar: You can also directly use the Java application. If
the sources are all located in a directory SRC_ROOT and the data and
hypertext files generated by OpenGrok are to be stored in DATA_ROOT, run

     $ java -jar opengrok.jar -s SRC_ROOT -d DATA_ROOT

See opengrok.jar manual below for more details.

Step.2 - Configure and Deploy source.war Webapp
===============================================
To configure the webapp source.war, look into the parameters defined in
web.xml of source.war file and change them (see note1) appropriately.

    * HEADER: is the fragment of HTML that will be used to display title or
    logo of your project
    * SRC_ROOT: the absolute path name of the root directory of your source tree
    * DATA_ROOT: absolute path of the directory where OpenGrok data
    files are stored


Optional Step.3 - Path Descriptions
-----------------------------------
OpenGrok uses path descriptions in various places (For eg. while showing
directory listings or search results) Example descriptions are in paths.tsv
file. You can list descriptions for directories one per line tab separated
format path tab description. Refer to example 4 below.

Note 1 - Changing webapp parameters: web.xml is the deployment descriptor
for the web application. It is in a Jar file named source.war, you can
change the :

    * Option 1: Unzip the file to TOMCAT/webapps/source/ directory and
    change the source/WEB-INF/web.xml and other static html files like
    index.html to customize to your project. 
    
    * Option 2: Extract the web.xml file from source.war file

    	$ unzip source.war WEB-INF/web.xml
	
    edit web.xml and re-package the jar file. 

    	$ zip -u source.war WEB-INF/web.xml

    Then copy the war files to <i>TOMCAT</i>/webapps directory.

    * Option 3: Edit the Context container element for the webapp

	Copy source.war to TOMCAT/webapps

        When invoking OpenGrok to build the index, use -w <webapp> to set the 
        context.

        After the index is built, there's a couple different ways to set the
        Context for the servlet container:
          - Add the Context inside a Host element in TOMCAT/conf/server.xml

	    <Context path="/<webapp>" docBase="source.war">
	        <Parameter name="DATA_ROOT" value="/path/to/data/root" override="false" />
		<Parameter name="SRC_ROOT" value="/path/to/src/root" override="false" />
		<Parameter name="HEADER" value='...' override="false" />
	        <Parameter name="SCAN_REPOS" value="false" override="false" />
	    </Context>

          - Create a Context file for the webapp

	    This file will be named `<webapp>.xml'.

	    For Tomcat, the file will be located at:
	    `TOMCAT/conf/<engine_name>/<hostname>', where <engine_name>
	    is the Engine that is processing requests and <hostname> is a Host
	    associated with that Engine.  By default, this path is
	    'TOMCAT/conf/Catalina/localhost' or 'TOMCAT/conf/Standalone/localhost'.

	    This file will contain something like the Context described above.

Optional Step 4 -- Subversion setup 
----------------------------------- 
Some additional setup is needed if you are using Subversion. OpenGrok uses
the Subversion javahl bindings, which must be installed separately.

svn-javahl.jar must be inserted in OpenGrok's classpath (you may do
this by copying the file into the lib-subdirectory in your OpenGrok
installation).
svn-javahl.jar is also needed by the web application, and you may
either copy the jar-file into WEB-INF/lib-directory or insert it into the
common directory for all web applications (For Tomcat 5.x, this is
`TOMCAT/common/lib/svn-javahl.jar')

The path to the native library svnjavahl needs to be added to
java.library.path for both the OpenGrok application and the OpenGrok
web application.

ex:
  java -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/svn -jar opengrok.jar ....
or, by using LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/svn java -jar opengrok.jar ...

---------------------------------------------------
Using Standalone Swing GUI
---------------------------------------------------
opengrok.jar when invoked without any arguments, opens up the GUI search window.
The interface is similar to cscope. 

To create an index, first select the browse button for "Search" drop down list.
Choose a directory to store the index (DATA_ROOT), and select the source tree 
(SRC_ROOT). You may have to also select path to ctags in the Advanced Options, 
if exuberant ctags can not be found in the PATH.

Clicking "Update" will create or update the search index.

The index can be searched using the cscope like GUI, which lets you customize
your favorite editor to open the matching files.

---------------------------------------------------
Using Findbugs
---------------------------------------------------
If you want to run Findbugs (http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) on OpenGrok,
you have to download Findbugs to your machine, and install it where you have 
checked out your OpenGrok source code, under the lib/findbugs directory,
like this:

   cd ~/.ant/lib
   wget http://..../findbugs-x.y.z.tar.gz
   gtar -xf findbugs-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv findbugs-x.y.z findbugs

You can now run ant with the findbugs target:

  ant findbugs
  ...
  findbugs:
   [findbugs] Executing findbugs from ant task
   [findbugs] Running FindBugs...
   [findbugs] Warnings generated: nnn
   [findbugs] Output saved to findbugs/findbugs.html

Now, open findbugs/findbugs.html in a web-browser, and start fixing bugs!

If you want to install findbugs some other place than ~/.ant/lib, you can untar the
.tar.gz file to a directory, and use the findbugs.home property to tell ant where to find
findbugs, like this (if you have installed fundbugs under the lib directory):

  ant findbugs -Dfindbugs.home=lib/findbug

There is also a findbugs-xml ant target that can be used to generate XML files that can
later be parsed, e.g. by Hudson.

---------------------------------------------------
Using Emma
---------------------------------------------------
If you want to check test coverage on OpenGrok, download Emma from
http://emma.sourceforge.net/. Place emma.jar and emma-ant.jar in the
opengrok/trunk/lib directory, or ~/.ant/lib.

Now you can instrument your classes, and create a jar file:

   ant emma-instrument

If you are using NetBeans, select File - "opengrok" Properties 
- libraries - Compile tab. Press the "Add JAR/Folder" and select
lib/emma.jar and lib/emma_ant.jar

If you are not using netbeans, you have to edit the file 
nbproject/project.properties, and add "lib/emma.jar" and 
"lib/emma_ant.jar" to the javac.classpath inside it.

Now you can put the classes into jars and generate distributables:

   ant dist

The classes inside opengrok.jar should now be instrumented.
If you use opengrok.jar for your own set of tests, you need 
emma.jar in the classpath.If you want to specify where to store 
the run time analysis, use these properties:

   emma.coverage.out.file=path/coverage.ec
   emma.coverage.out.merge=true

The coverage.ec file should be placed in the opengrok/trunk/coverage
directory for easy analyzation.

If you want to test the coverage of the unit tests, you can
run the tests:

   ant test   (Or Alt+F6 in NetBeans)

Now you should get some output saying that Emma is placing runtime 
coverage data into coverage.ec.

To generate reports, run ant again:

   ant emma-report

Look at coverage/coverage.txt, coverage/coverage.xml and 
coverage/coverage.html to see how complete your tests are.
