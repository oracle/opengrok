/**
 * {@code LazilyInstantiate} is a quick class to make lazily instantiating
 * objects easy. All you need to know for working with this class is its two
 * public methods: one static factory for creating the object, and another for
 * initiating the instantiation and retrieval of the object.
 * <p>
 * Also, another benefit is that it's thread safe, but only blocks when
 * initially instantiating the object. After that, it stops blocking and removes
 * unnecessary checks for whether the object is instantiated.
 * <p>
 * Here's an example of it being used for implementing a singleton:
 * <code>
 * public class Singleton<br>
 * {<br>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; private static Supplier&lt;Singleton&gt; instance =
 * LazilyInstantiate.using(() -&gt; new Singleton());<br>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; //other fields<br>
 * <br>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; public static getInstance()<br>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; instance.get();<br>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
 * <br>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; //other methods<br>
 * <br>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; private Singleton()<br>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; //contructor stuff<br>
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
 * }<br>
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * So, here are the changes you'll need to apply in your code:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Change the type of the lazily instantiated object to a {@code Supplier}
 * of that <i>type</i>
 * <li>Have it set to LazilyInstantiate.using() where the argument is
 * {@code () -> <instantiation code>} You could also use a method reference,
 * which, for the example above, would be {@code Singleton::new} instead of
 * {@code () -> new Singleton()}</li>
 * <li>Whatever asks for the object, asks for the {@code Supplier} object, then
 * {@code .get()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of object that you're trying to lazily instantiate
