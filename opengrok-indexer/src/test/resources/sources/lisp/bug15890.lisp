;; Test for bug #15890. Ctags and JFlex do not agree on line
;; numbering. JFlex regards \u000B, \u000C, \u0085, \u2028 and \u2029
;; as line terminator, whereas ctags doesn't. If one of these
;; characters occurred in a file, definitions that came after it would
;; not be recognized as definitions by the xrefs, since the line
;; numbers didn't match what ctags returned.

;; This line contains \u000B: 

;; This line contains \u000C: 

;; This line contains \u0085: 

;; This line contains \u2028:  

;; This line contains \u2029:  

;; Now add a definition for the tests to check.
