@# The "notify" file controls where notifications from watches set by
# "cvs watch add" or "cvs edit" are sent.  The first entry on a line is
# a regular expression which is tested against the directory that the
# change is being made to, relative to the $CVSROOT.  If it matches,
# then the remainder of the line is a filter program that should contain
# one occurrence of %s for the user to notify, and information on its
# standard input.
#
# "ALL" or "DEFAULT" can be used in place of the regular expression.
#
# format strings are replaceed as follows:
#    %c = canonical name of the command being executed
#    %R = the name of the referrer, if any, otherwise the value NONE
#    %p = path relative to repository
#    %r = repository (path portion of $CVSROOT)
#    %s = user to notify
#
# For example:
#ALL (echo Committed to %r/%p; cat) |mail %s -s "CVS notification"
