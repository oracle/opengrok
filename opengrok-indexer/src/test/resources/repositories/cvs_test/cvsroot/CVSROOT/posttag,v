@# The "posttag" file is called after the "tag" command finishes
# processing a directory.
#
# If any format strings are present in the filter, they will be replaced
# as follows:
#    %b = branch mode = "?" (delete ops - unknown) | "T" (branch)
#                     | "N" (not branch)
#    %o = operation = "add" | "mov" | "del"
#    %c = canonical name of the command being executed
#    %R = the name of the referrer, if any, otherwise the value NONE
#    %p = path relative to repository
#    %r = repository (path portion of $CVSROOT)
#    %t = tagname
#    %{sVv} = attribute list = file name, old version tag will be deleted
#             from, new version tag will be added to (or deleted from, but
#             this feature is deprecated.  When either old or new revision is
#             unknown, doesn't exist, or isn't applicable, the string "NONE"
#             will be placed on the command line.
#
# Note that %{sVv} is a list operator and not all elements are necessary.
# Thus %{sV} is a legal format string, but will only be replaced with file
# name and old revision. it also generates multiple arguments for each file
# being operated upon.  i.e. if two files, file1 & file2, are having a tag
# moved from version 1.1 to version 1.1.2.9, %{sVv} will generate the
# following six arguments in this order:
# file1, 1.1, 1.1.2.9, file2, 1.1, 1.1.2.9.
#
# The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being committed to, relative
# to the $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, then the remainder
# of the line is the name of the filter to run.
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in this
# file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name "ALL" appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or "DEFAULT".
