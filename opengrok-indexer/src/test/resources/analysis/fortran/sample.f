*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> DGESV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
*>    A * X = B,
*> where A is an N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*>
*> The LU decomposition with partial pivoting and row interchanges is
*> used to factor A as
*>    A = P * L * U,
*> where P is a permutation matrix, L is unit lower triangular, and U is
*> upper triangular.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the
*> system of equations A * X = B.
*> \endverbatim
*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>          The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
*>          matrix A.  N >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NRHS
*> \verbatim
*>          NRHS is INTEGER
*>          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*>          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*>          On entry, the N-by-N coefficient matrix A.
*>          On exit, the factors L and U from the factorization
*>          A = P*L*U; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDA
*> \verbatim
*>          LDA is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] IPIV
*> \verbatim
*>          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>          The pivot indices that define the permutation matrix P;
*>          row i of the matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] B
*> \verbatim
*>          B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*>          On entry, the N-by-NRHS matrix of right hand side matrix B.
*>          On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDB
*> \verbatim
*>          LDB is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] INFO
*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>          = 0:  successful exit
*>          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*>          > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*>                has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*>                singular, so the solution could not be computed.
