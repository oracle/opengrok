<b>OpenGrok - a "wicked fast" source browser!</b></p>

<p>
This is the front page of your <a 
href="xref/">browsable and searchable source tree</a> (<a 
href="xref/">xref/</a>).</p>

<p>
To setup and configure OpenGrok please refer to <a 
href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/opengrok/"
>http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/opengrok/</a> or README.txt in the 
distribution.</p>

<p>
You can replace this block of text (in index_body.html) with some more useful
information about your source tree and its organization, with direct 
links to key parts of code base.
